# Heading out
## Hitching up
- Take all bars and hitch out of the small externally accessable compartment on the passenger side of the trailer (the cubby)
- Ball mount connects to truck with one bolt secured by a cotter pin (I believe there's only one hole on the hitch mount on truck that this connects to?).
- If the yellow ball lock is in place, the all silver key will let you remove it. (Throw it back on please if you park the trailer)
- Remove cotter pin, raise ball coupler lever, fit ball onto coupler, lower ball coupler and ensure cotter pin is replaced.
- Sway bars are fitted into the rings to the sides and below the ball mount - pull up past the notch and rotate towards trailer.  Remove securing pin from the trailer mounted sway bar brackets.  Hang chain from (ideally) the 4th link taking care to ensure the link hangs from the hanger bolt, not pinching the slack link between the post.  It should look like the following: where () are the ends of the hanger link O are the other connecting chain links and X is the hanger bolt attached to the bracket ->

  ( ) O O X ( )     -- up direction -->

  and not like->

  ( ) O X O ( )     -- up -->

  or 

  ( ) X O O ( )

  There is a foot long silver pipe in the cubby that will help lever the chain bracket up.  Replace the securing clip on the brackets when they are up - they're a bit of a pain in the ass to get back in when the bracket is raised.  Jiggle it.  Jiggle it some more.  Make sure to put the pipe back in the cubby.
- Safety chains are hooked on underneath the ball mount over top of the sway bars
- Sway plate has two cotter pins at the ends, remove them.  Ensure the bar is not tensioned by rotating the control rod towards off.  If it is engaged, the rod will be tougher to turn.  Put the vertical ball onto the ball mount to the right of the trailer ball.  Push the Sway plate to extent or retract it so that you can mount the horizontal ball on the trailer toungue.  Replace both cotter pins.  Turn control rod "on" until tensioned.
- Emergency stop with the blue carabiner should attach to the safety chain ring as far to the driver's side of the car as possible.  Ensure this wire hangs free and does not drag - if caught it will engage the trailer brakes!
- Raise the main hitch post
- Raise the four feet at the corners of the trailer with the black bar with the hand grip in the cubby.
- Wiring harness connects to truck
- Check lights.  Ensure there's a ".c." showing on the trailer brake control to the right of the driver's knee.
- If propane tanks are not mounted raise the nut holding the notched bar on the threaded rod - do not remove it.  Get the base of the tank onto one side of the threaded rod, taking care to fit the tank bottom ring inside the white support.  Ensure the tank outlet is facing back towards the trailer.  Ensure notches in the bar fit over the bottom of the apeture for the tank handles.  Fit the second tank and screw the nut down as far as possible.  This should lower the notched bar onto both the tank handle holes pulling them towards the trailer toungue.  They should not be movable (or rather move with the threaded rod / tank assembly) when the nut is fully lowered.  attach both tank couplers and ensure the tank valves are both closed.

## Driving notes
- if it's windy the trailer may feel like it's swaying.  you can engage trailer brakes with a lever that swings right to left on the bottom of the brake controller.

## Setting up at campsite
- lower the main hitch post.
- take all the 'hitching up' connections off (i put the bars under the tounge generally, out of the rain and away from the kids - i also remove the ball mount as it can bang into shit when you're driving around with the trailer.)
- adjust hitch post to make camper level-ish.
- lower four corner feet with hand grip bar. 
- One key opens both lock bars at either end of the trailer.  Ease the ends down and raise the end bar (canvas should keep it up).  Attach velcro on all three sides and pull the outer canvas down over the lip.
- The step under the door will swing up and out.  The bracket for it is bent and it might take a bit of force to pull it up, out and down.
- First fit the spreader bars (look like a J with a long vertical) plastic on the middle of the metal end support and depress the metal knob to insert it into the round clip on the middle of the wall above the bed.  Do this above either bed.
- unlock the door and (recommended) open the ceiling van vent with the black handle on the roof.  it gets warm in there when you're unpacking.
- move as much out the way as possible.  favour putting bags 'out of the way' on the bed above the toungue.  much of the stuff under the mattresses can be moved outside (chairs, gas stove/table in a black bag and portable tarp shelter thing in a grey bag).  The white plastic shelf unit has dishes and cutlery, take it out as well (note under *rain*)
- mattresses on the bed and you're good to go.
- there's a vent cover and insulator if it gets cold at night.  just fit the insulator into the cover and slide it under the brackets.

# storage
- there's a compartment in between the door and the back bed that flips up, it's about 6 inches deep and 3 feet tall and as wide as the camper (call it the back compartment).  There's a similar one on the other side (front compartment).  Fridge below, freezer above, dry food storage beside those.  Below the dry food is a compartment with disposable plates and paper products.  The drawer across near the roof has paper towel, kleenex and hand soap in it.  lighters, knives and some toiletries are in the drawer under the sink.

# Situational stuff and amenities

## rain
- the white drawer unit should be somewhere where it won't get rained on.  it's fine, but if the rain is strong enough dirt splashes back on / up into it and it sucks to clean off.  putting it under the awning is a good plan if rain's in the forecast
- the roof fan has a cover, lower it to make sure rain doesn't get in.  ditto for the washroom fan.

### awning
- you'll need to find a silver rod with a circle on one end and a 90 degree bend on the other in the cubby
- turn the black knobs on the backside of the cream coloured awning uprights until they are loose.  halfway up each upright, there's a plastic lever with a keeper clip on it.  push the keeper clip up and flip the lever upwards (stops perpendicular to the upright).
- use the circle end of the rod to hook over a small toggle at the car end of the awning canvas roll.  pull or push (not sure) to move the toggle to the other position. 
- use the bend end of the rod to hook into the black strap end halfway between the uprights.  if you've done the last two steps right, you should be able to pull the rod down and extend the awning outwards from the camper (pull it by hand when you can).  if you extract the awning to far, it's hard to open the door because of the angle the awning assumes.  you can remove the uprights and use them vertically from the ground for more space, but don't.  it's a hassle.
- to put the awning back, hold the black strap tense and switch the toggle at the car end to the other position (that you switched with the circle end of the rod) and slowly let it retract towards the camper.
- once awning is up, flip the cream upright clips down and tighten the black knobs, replace silver rod in the cubby

### portable awning
- grey bag about 6' long - has a foldout structure and tarp top.  it's awesome for rain or for shade.  the legs take some figuring out, but they extend in two parts with those metal bumps on two sides of the legs to retract them.  it's easier to figure out than to explain.
- *insert instruction link here*

## propane
- behind the threaded rod holding the tanks down there's a plastic supply switcher pointing to the left or right tank, rotate it to switch where the propane is coming from.
- open the valve of the tank pointed at by above
- switch the last two if you need to
- close tanks when you're driving
- fridge runs on propane when set to 'gas'.  cools down faster on gas, maybe doesn't at all on power (seems like only freezer is on?).  it's a bit tricky to get running on propane.  once propane is hooked up and valve is opened, -light one burner on the inside stove- and flip fridge from off to gas.  the 'gas' indicator on the fridge should turn on with a solid orange light and stay solid.  if it starts flashing the regulator on the tank has stopped the propane flow.  it usually works with one burner going and usually doesn't if it is off.
- internal heater runs on propane too.  the fan for it is crazy loud and you probably don't want to use it.  wakes me up in the night, let alone kids.  we have a electrical black stading heater for that - see heater below.
- there's a gas port on the outside underbody of the trailer that mates to the gas hose for the table/burner combo in the heavy black bag - it's covered by a yellow rubber cover.  remove cover and hook it up the only way it goes.  There's a cutoff valve above the pipe to which the yellow cover was connected.  Turning it inline with the pipe opens gas to the burner, turning it perpendicular shuts it off.  I think either the burner, hose or the connectors leak - not enough to smell when it's burning, but turn off the cutoff when you're not actually operating the burner.  This sounds alarming - I've only smelled gas when operating the external stove while the cutoff is on, just to put your mind a little more at ease.
 
## heater
- internal heater, loud fan, needs propane.
- electric heater see electrical below.  instructions for heater if needed should be above the sink (i'm going to move these to the trailer manual bag...)

## water connection / tank
- white water hose in the back storage compartment is for potable water. 
- 2 ways of connecting the water:
  - white hose into site tap and into city connection relys on site pressure to force water through
  - there's another white cover where you can shoot water into that stores the water in the camper's water tank.  if you get down on the ground you'll see a shut off valve below this inlet, off is handle facing inwards to the camper, open is facing out.  make sure that it is closed and the sink taps are off before adding water.

### water pump
- turn on to add water pressure to tanked water for sink / toilet operation.  can be left on.  is moderately loud.  turn off before camper tear down.

### water heater
- make sure all air is out of camper's water system before turning on.  fill tank (or attach city water supply inlet) and open both sink knobs till no air coughs out, then turn heater on.

### sink
- any water put in here goes to the grey water storage.  same with the shower.  if you use the toilet at all it helps when flushing waste to have a bit of grey water.

### toilet
- goes to black water tank.  we only use this for peeing at night, not for pooping.
- there's a ceiling fan - push to open cover on the roof, pull to close.  the red button turns on the fan.
- flush instructions are on it, pretty straightforward.

### shower
- i've only used the inside one for cleaning stuff.
- there's an outside one that you need a key to get to, but it works well too.

## power sites
### electrical
- all lights, water heater, fridge run off electric power.  to use, connect high amp cord to the side of trailer opposite the door - has flip up cover and probably needs the yellow extension cord to fit into the outlet.
- the battery should be charged if you're not plugged in.  you should be able to run most things off it for a couple of days.  the big draws will be the electric heater, the microwave and the ceiling fan.
- breaker / fuse box is below the fridge, push cover to release it, push it in again and it will stay.
- sometimes if an led is lit indicating no power (only had this happen with the fridge so far) removing and replacing the fuse will help.  spare 15amp fuses are slottet into the connectors on the bottom of the rack (no description, or 'O' written beside them).
- we've used the microwave once i think, and tend to store the spare light/fan units in there, check for empty before you run it.
- the spare light/fan units clip onto the bed spreader bars and plug via the headphone jacks into the sockets in the roof.
- the fan in the roof uses a lot of power if you're running off battery.
- there's AC outlets to the left of the fridge near the roof and to the left of the inside stove.  120v / 60hz.
- there's a 12v lighter plug below the ac outlet by the fridge, it's got a 2 port usb charger thingie in it.  if you pull it out and put it back in, don't put it all the way or an led will come on.
- the electric heater is 12.5amp max and the fuses are at 15amp so if you're using the heater, it's probably best to use it by itself on that socket.
- you can check battery and water levels(fresh/grey/black) with the white unit up front.

# packing up
- same as a normal trailer, all the heavy shit up front and low to the floor
- close and cover roof vent, washroom vent.  make sure to empty fridge and freezer.  ensure sink is empty.  hold down toilet flusher for a bit, run the majority of the water into the grey tank.
- close awning, relock awning uprights.
- remove spreader bars and collapse and unvecro ends, move ends halfway up.  fold canvas in on itself and close ends fully, making sure no canvas is caught around the edges.
- pull down and lock end supports
- ensure propane off
- retract front two legs (leaving main toungue post down)
- ensure all the crap is in the camper,  retract back legs and lock camper door ( with only main post down it's not super safe to go in).
- rehitch

# draining waste
- in a campsite with a dump station, pull up to the hole.  inside the cubby is a green plastic bin with blue gloves and a red elbow.  don gloves, remove elbow.  rear trailer bumper is hollow with a plastic cover on the drivers side.  remove and pull out the red plastic waste tube.  remove waste cover on driver's side pump underneath back corner of trailer.  attach hose to waste pipe.  attach other end to the elbow and stick the elbow in the dump hole.  pull back large (black water) scissor valve (should pull back i think).  let waste drain for a while then pull grey water valve (should pull towards you).  This will flush the black water out.  let it drain until done.  usually 5m or so.
- usually there's a hose and usually it sucks.  spray off both ends of the waste tube and the elbow.
- replace tube in bumper and re-cover.  put gloves and elbow in the green bin and that back in the cubby.  you can get the gloves off by standing on them.
- dump stations are pretty gross.  boots or shoes help and it's worth having a baby wipe for after this.
